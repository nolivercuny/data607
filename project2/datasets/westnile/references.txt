There are two tables here with the cases each year in a separate column:

West Nile virus disease cases reported to CDC by state of residence, 1999-2019

West Nile virus neuroinvasive disease cases reported to CDC by state of residence, 1999-2019

The totals per state & per year are already calculated, but the means are yet to be calculated.

The year columns could be pivoted longer and the 2 tables could be combined. Percent of positive cases that developed into neuroinvasive disease could be calculated (per year / per state).
