# Project 4 - Document Classification

## Overview

It can be useful to be able to classify new "test" documents using already classified "training" documents.  A common example is using a corpus of labeled spam and ham (non-spam) e-mails to predict whether or not a new document is spam.  

For this project, you can start with a spam/ham dataset, then predict the class of new documents (either withheld from the training dataset or from another source such as your own spam folder).   One example corpus:   https://spamassassin.apache.org/old/publiccorpus/
