# Week 11 Homework

## Overview

Your task is to analyze an existing recommender system that you find interesting.  You should:

Perform a Scenario Design analysis as described below.  Consider whether it makes sense for your selected recommender system to perform scenario design twice, once for the organization (e.g. Amazon.com) and once for the organization's customers.
Attempt to reverse engineer what you can about the site, from the site interface and any available information that you can find on the Internet or elsewhere.
Include specific recommendations about how to improve the site's recommendation capabilities going forward. 
Create your report using an R Markdown file, and create a discussion thread with a link to the GitHub repo where your Markdown file notebook resides.  You are not expected to need to write code for this discussion assignment.
Here are two examples of the kinds of papers that might be helpful backgrounders for your research in #2 above (if you had chosen amazon.com or nytimes.com as your web site):

IEEE Internet Computing, Greg Linden, Brent Smith, and Jeremy York (2003): Amazon.com Recommendations:  Item-to-Item Collaborative Filtering.
Alex Spangher (2015): Building the Next New York Times Recommendation Engine.
