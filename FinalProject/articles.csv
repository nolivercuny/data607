But technology is creeping in, and now some hams are being monitored by mobile phone. Matt Hilburn reports from Guijuelo, Spain.","Science","GUIJUELO, Spain — This sleepy and somewhat shabby town of 5,000 in the middle of the barren Castilian plain is hardly the place you would expect to see new technology being developed in an industry that dates back thousands of years.Guijuelo is a ham town, where, according to Spaniards, the best of their beloved ""jamón Ibérico,"" or Iberian ham, is made. The air hangs thick with the pungent smell of curing ham, and about the only traffic on the streets are trucks carrying the prized meat to all corners of Spain.""Ninety-nine point nine percent of the economy here is centered on ham,"" said José María Il de Fonso of Inporcasa, one of the town’s 200 or so producers, none of which has more than a handful of employees.From salting to aging, the artisan producers in the village have had ham down to a science for centuries, but Inporcasa is introducing the traditional industry to the modern world, using WAP technology to help monitor the lengthy process of curing.In each of its six salting and curing rooms, where the ham must be kept in strictly maintained climatic control for anywhere between a year and a half to three years, the company has installed monitoring devices that resemble microphones, which measure temperature and humidity -- and feed that information into a WAP server.Employees, by calling into the system with their mobile phones, can check the status of each room from anywhere they happen to be. The system is currently monitoring some 60,000 hams.""The critical time is the first 80 days,"" Il de Fonso said. ""Any variation in temperature or humidity in just one room could ruin 2,000 hams, costing 7 or 8 million pesetas (over $40,000).""That new technology is being developed for such an old industry might sound odd to non-Spaniards, but the importance of pork, particularly ham, in Spanish culture can not be overstated.For nearly 2,500 years, the treasured -- at times worshipped -- Iberian pig has shaped the national identity (some say waistline as well).According to Il de Fonso, eating pork was an important method of testing one’s faith during the re-conquest of Spain from the Moors, whose dietary laws forbade them from eating swine. Eating pork was also used to test the veracity of Jewish conversion to Catholicism.Today, one of Madrid’s most popular restaurant chains is the Museo de Jamón, or Ham Museum, where the walls are adorned with hundreds of the fatty, cloven-hoofed legs. Hams hang from the walls at virtually every neighborhood bar, and the meat, which can sell for upwards of $20 a pound, is a popular gift item.Most of the Iberian pigs, an indigenous breed to Spain, live just south of Guijuelo in the Spanish province of Extremadura and are brought to Guijuelo for slaughter and processing. They eat only acorns, which gives their meat a delightful earthy taste that is so sought after.""During the peak season, from December to March, some 8,500 pigs are killed here every day,"" Il de Fonso said. ""They’re electrocuted because the animal rights people won’t let us kill them in the traditional way -- by bleeding them.""","https://www.wired.com/2001/10/hambones-connected-to-wap-phone","31"

Rumsfeld said targeted two or three dozen sites. British officials said 30 targets had been hit and further operations were imminent.Rumsfeld warned that the battle against terrorism will not be short-lived or solved by military action alone.""We have to expect it could take some years, several years,"" he said on CNN. ""This problem is not going to be rooted out by cruise missiles.""The strikes will last days or longer before a significant letup, a Pentagon official said. The first wave Sunday was followed by airdrops of food and medicine to Afghanistan's beleaguered people.""We feel that thus far this has been a very successful effort,"" Rumsfeld said. He told The Associated Press that the assault targeted two to three dozens sites, including terrorist training camps, military airfields, military aircraft, air defense radars and surface-to-air missile sites.Rumsfeld rejected Taliban claims that they had shot down an aircraft, as well as claims of significant civilian casualties.""We have approved every single target - and each one is a military target,"" he told the AP.""There is no question but that any people who were around those targets were around those targets because they were part of the al-Qaida and the Taliban military,"" he said on NBC. Rumsfeld said all planes had landed safely or were en route to their home bases.The chief of Britain's defense staff, Adm. Michael Boyce, said the initial offensive was aimed at knocking out Taliban anti-aircraft defenses and Afghanistan's tiny air force. British Defense Secretary Geoff Hoon said 30 targets had been hit and that damage was inflicted.Firepower struck military command centers of the Taliban regime in Kandahar, Pentagon officials said, and Afghan sources said smoke billowed from the high-walled compound of Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar, who was believed to have fled.Explosions also rocked Kabul, the capital, and were heard coming from or near some of the training camps of Osama bin Laden, the West's most hunted man.""The battle is now joined on many fronts,"" President Bush said. ""We will not waver, we will not tire, we will not falter, and we will not fail.""The Taliban's ambassador to neighboring Pakistan said 20 civilians in the Kabul area were killed by missiles. Taliban officials also said three people were killed and three or four were injured in Kandahar. A check of Kabul's four hospitals turned up no reports of casualties.In Pakistan, violence broke out in two volatile cities along the border with Afghanistan. Thousands of Taliban supporters battled police and burned buildings, with two U.N. offices among the targets. One person was killed and 26 were hurt in the southwestern city of Quetta, a doctor said.Pakistan's president insisted his support of the U.S.-led coalition reflected the will of the people.In all, Afghan targets were pounded by 15 land-based bombers, including B-2 Stealths from Missouri, and 50 U.S. and British cruise missiles fired from surface ships and submarines in the Arabian sea, said Air Force Gen. Richard Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.","https://www.wired.com/2001/10/bush-vows-relentless-campaign","40"
